# Phantom Code of Conduct

**Phantom is a tool developed to help developers.** Were it to be useful to people and were a community of contributors to arise around it, I would like that community to focus around that mission.

This means that, to those who want to help, we should always default to an attitude of warm welcome and kindnessâ€”regardless of experience or background.

## Expected Behavior

- Be polite.
- Be welcoming.
- Be kind and patient to inexperience.
- Be respectful and curious toward experience.
- Try your best not to take things personally.
- Be tolerant of other viewpoints and ideas.
- Be supportive and look out for each other.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment may include but not limited to the following:

- Offensive, inappropriate, or unwanted comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or age, or other protected categories under applicable law.
- Visual harassment eg. sexual imagery or use of sexual language
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion
- Intimidation or bullying

## Reporting and Enforcement

- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact Vic at `vic@sidiousvic.dev`.
